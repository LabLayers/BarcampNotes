## Basics

- Need a board!

- Reach out to folks
- It's not magic
- Can happen anytime anyone can put in the effort to do it

## Team

- Head
- Designer
  - "OCD Person"
  - Every year the brand evolves
- Finance
  - Badge, food, parties for only $10-15!
  - Made possibly by sponsor outreach
- Twitter! Twitter! Social Media People!

- Brininging people onto the team
- Trust and responsibility
- Not a ton of oversight
- No one's job

## Advice

- **Start early** as a learning experience
- **Start earlier**
  - Ticket sales
  - BC won't sell out until 8am the day before the event

## Size

- First year: 160
- This year: 500

- No minimum for a successful event
  - Depends on what you set out to do
    - BC wants board to be full
- 20 people may be enough
- Barcamp is a scalable model
- **There is no "right" Barcamp**

## Model

- TL;DR: Started with O'Riley
  - FooCamp
    - Foo = Bar software reference
  - Expensive
  - Very very cureated
  - Nice to have
  - The heck with O'Riley, we'll start our own
  - Hard to attend
- Forked to Barcamp
  - Anyone can attend
  - Started with no advance ticket sales
  - Of the people, for the people
  - No tracks
  - No recruitment
  - Board notion
  - No one needs to ask for permission for the BarCamp trademark
  - Vote with your feet
- Philly is one of the bigger ones
  - Money is charged
    - Guilt for paying but not showing up
    - Didn't want to plan for 500 but only 300 showed up
    - Sessions that promote products are discourged (but not banned)
  - Theme is centered around the people who showed up
    - It is an "anything you want to do" conference
    - Feedback loop based on people who show up
    - Trended in one way, encourages people to branched out
- BarCamp is subset of **Unconference** format

## Logistics

- **Start early**
- Donated spaces
  - IT department pays for security, housecleaning, chairs moved
- Food
  - Look at how many tickets have been sold for estimates
  - Caterers
  - BACON
  - Planned 2 weeks in advanced

## Venue

- Logistics are weeks in advance
- Chaos can still make it work (staircases)
- Value is all in brininging community & energy to one place
- Not like you come to Warton any have them say "ABSOLUTELY"
- Example: come up to Coworking space

## Spread the Word

- **Make friends**
- **Spread the word**
  - Start spreading the word about what you want to see
- Encourage others
- 1600 person email blast
- How to give a talk as a first timer

## Sponsorship

- $15,800 2013 budget
  - 5% signed off to external tax company
    - $500-600 went away
- $18,000 2014 budget
  - $600 in bacon
  - $13,000 in sponsorship
    - For food, shirts,
  - Insurance is provided by space
  - Taxes is paid with anything asociated with event
  - Created an LLC to handle its own tax
- **Don't stress money**
  - Money is NOT the object
  - You could charge a high fee or find sponsorships
  - Kickstarting? Why not!
